The decorations and ambiance will take you to somewhere there in one of the Indian states of Rajasthan which has often been used as a site for filming movies !! We tried many lovely options for starters i cant remember the name but the first one was spicy shrimp the second one is seekh kebab and the third was small breads filled with chicken !! All was so good and highly recommend. For the main course we ordered butter lobster and jeera rice! Soooo yummy !!! And in between the chief was so generous in sending bites of happiness !!!! More than three dishes were served complementary and was so nice specially the macaroon which i liked the most!! Thank you Joshpur team for the magical experience!",

The place looks very nice! I private seating areas and upbeat music playing, a bit dim.We ordered some dim sum! Chicken spring rolls and chive & prawn dumplings.Typically when you order these dishes they are full of fillers so it was so great to see they are generous filling it with real meat not just mush! The flavors were very nice for both but keep in mind they're quite small when placing your order!For mains we got stir-fried duck with chili sauce and Singapore noodles with chicken.Both delicious!! Highly recommend both, the duck was nicely coated with the sweet chili sauce and the duck was cooked very nicely, not soggy or tough to eat we downed it pretty fast!Noodles were nicely flavored with small pieces of chicken with it.We paid about 160QR, it's not a cheap takeaway but it's definitely the best food we took away and as of now the best Indo-Chinese takeaway we have tried in town! Definitely recommend all that we ordered!",

Despite being quite busy, the waiter's greeted us with a smile and a menu.

So I was excited when, late on a Saturday night, my husband and I along with another couple grabbed beers at an off license around the corner and braved the hour long standing catch up. This place is worth every minutes of the wait! My husband and I shared the following: scallop - yum; trotter nuggets  - delicious; classic bao - so yum; confit pork bao - everything bao inspires to be; fried chicken bao - my only hang up was this bao seemed a bit dry; lamb shoulder bao - so much flavour.. ties for 1st place with the confit pork! I was devastated at the end of the meal to find out they had run out of the ice cream! Just means I have a great excuse to return another time!",

Scallops: just one piece and wouldn't order this again. Not great. Taiwanese chicken with ketchup: just regular fried chicken with ketchup over it. Wouldn't order it again. Horlicks ice cream bao: loved this. Soft bun and amazing ice creamTaiwanese whiskey: delicious. Must try Peanut milk: tasted like snickers chocolate and I could have finished a whole bottle of this. SOO GOOD!!! Would go back for the sweet stuff for sure. Cute place but could do with more of a variety. Excellent service.",
